# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales data from Doremi, an online retail store, in order to:

**Identify Sales Seasonality Trends**: Analyze historical sales data to determine the optimal times to stock certain products based on demand fluctuations throughout the year.

**Identify High-Demand Products**: Identify products with consistently high sales to help guide marketing and procurement strategies.

These insights will support the marketing and procurement teams in aligning product availability with demand trends, ensuring efficient inventory management and targeted promotional efforts.
